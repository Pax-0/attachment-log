# Attachment log

The bot will log attatchments to a channel.

# Setup:
- Firstly clone this repo where you plan to have the bot hosted as follows:
- Open a terminal where you want the bot files to go, run:
 `git clone https://github.com/Unknown401/attachment-log.git`
    *This may prompt you to login since this is a private repo*
afterwards there should be a new folder, navigate to it using `cd attachment-log` then: 

- Rename `config_example.json` to `config.json` and paste your discord bot token in the token variable.
- Run `npm install` in the console.
- Run the bot with `node index.js` *Or any other runtime you have installed.*
- use the setup command.

# Requirements:
- NodeJS 8.0.0 or higher.
